Your task is to analyze the provided environmental data, weather forecast, plant growth stage, and any user observations to predict potential pest and disease risks for Coriander.
Provide a detailed and actionable assessment.

Crop: {{cropType}}
Average Temperature: {{averageTemperatureC}}°C
Average Humidity: {{averageHumidityPercent}}%
Plant Growth Stage: {{plantGrowthStage}}
User's Recent Observations: {{{recentPestActivityNotes}}}
7-Day Weather Forecast:
{{{sevenDayWeatherForecastSummary}}}

Based on this information, generate a JSON output according to the defined schema.
Key considerations:
- Identify 2-4 common Coriander pests and diseases relevant to the provided conditions. Examples include: Aphids, Powdery Mildew, Damping Off (especially if 'Seedling' stage), Bacterial Leaf Spot, Fusarium Wilt, Root Rot.
- For each identified pest/disease:
    - Assess the riskLevel (Negligible, Low, Medium, High, Very High) based on how the input data (temperature, humidity, forecast, stage) aligns with conditions favorable for it.
    - Provide a brief description of the pest/disease.
    - List common symptoms observable on Coriander.
    - Detail the contributingFactors from the input data that elevate or decrease its risk. **Crucially, explain *how* these factors (e.g., 'High humidity ({{averageHumidityPercent}}%) as seen in the forecast for the next 3 days significantly increases the risk of Powdery Mildew because fungal spores thrive in such conditions', or 'Temperatures consistently above 28°C ({{averageTemperatureC}}°C) can stress coriander, making it more susceptible to Fusarium Wilt, especially if soil moisture is also high.') specifically contribute to the likelihood of *this particular* pest or disease. Do not simply list the environmental data itself as a risk factor like "High temperature".**
    - Suggest specific, actionable preventativeActions.
    - If applicable, list organicTreatmentOptions.
    - If applicable, list chemicalTreatmentOptions and include a standard caution about following label instructions and safety.
- Generate a concise overallOutlook summarizing the findings.
- If any risks are 'High' or 'Very High', list them as criticalWarnings.
- Populate the 'predictionMethodologyExplanation' field: Provide a brief paragraph. Start by stating that this analysis is derived from a broad understanding of plant science, including botany and horticulture. Then, explain that the predictions consider how common coriander pests and diseases typically respond to various environmental conditions (such as temperature, humidity, weather patterns like rain) and how the plant's growth stage can influence its susceptibility. Conclude by mentioning that the advice also incorporates general agricultural best practices for coriander cultivation. It's important to clarify this is a synthesis of information, not a real-time search of specific documents or research papers.
- Always include the standard disclaimer.

Focus on providing practical advice. For example, if high humidity is a contributing factor to Powdery Mildew risk, suggest 'Improve air circulation by ensuring adequate spacing between plants and using fans if in a controlled environment' as a preventative action.
If the weather forecast indicates upcoming rain and sustained high humidity, this might increase the risk of fungal diseases like Powdery Mildew or Bacterial Leaf Spot. Link the forecast directly to these diseases in 'contributingFactors'.
If the plant stage is 'Seedling' and conditions are damp and cool, 'Damping Off' risk is higher. Explain this link in 'contributingFactors' for Damping Off.
If 'No specific observations noted' by user, rely solely on environmental data to link to specific pest/disease risks.
Ensure the scientificName is accurate if provided.
If conditions are generally unfavorable for most common pests/diseases, reflect this in 'Negligible' or 'Low' risk levels and a positive overallOutlook. For example, if it's consistently dry and cool, the risk for many fungal diseases will be low; state this in 'contributingFactors' for relevant diseases.
